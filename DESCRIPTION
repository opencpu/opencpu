Description: The OpenCPU framework exposes a web API interfacing R, Latex and
    Pandoc. This API is used for example to integrate statistical functionality
    into systems, share and execute scripts or reports on centralized servers,
    and build R based "apps". The OpenCPU server can run either as a
    single-user server inside the interactive R session (using httpuv), or as a
    cloud server that builds on Linux and rApache. The current R package forms
    the core of the framework. When loaded in R, it automatically initiates the
    single-user server and displays the web address in the console. For more
    information, visit the OpenCPU website.
